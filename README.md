StudentManagementSystem

Description:
This repository contains the source code for a Student Management System implemented in Java using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity). The system enables the management of student records including their personal information such as name, age, and grade.

Key Features:

Database Integration: Utilizes JDBC for seamless integration with a MySQL database to store and manage student records.
CRUD Operations: Implements Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for managing student records within the database.
Modular Design: Follows a modular design pattern with separate Java classes for representing students, managing database operations, and potentially a user interface.
Testing: Includes comprehensive test cases to ensure the reliability and functionality of the Student Management System.

Technology Stack:
Programming Language: Java - Utilized for its robustness, platform independence, and extensive library support.
Database Management System (DBMS): MySQL - A popular open-source relational database management system known for its reliability, performance, and ease of use.
Java Database Connectivity (JDBC): JDBC - The standard Java API for connecting and interacting with relational databases. It provides methods for executing SQL queries, retrieving results, and managing transactions.
